<b>Raspberry Pi 3 Garage Door Monitor</b>

This application was developed in C# for a Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows IoT Core. Its goal is to monitor a garage door switch
(or any switch) and send an alert e-mail when the door has been left open for a predefined amount of time. The switch is 
wired between a GPIO pin and ground, as shown <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/samples/pushbutton">here</a>.
